## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK
- Firebase setup

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alekla0126/fotosfera.git
   cd fotosfera
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Configure Firebase:
   - Ensure you have `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) set up.
   - Initialize Firebase in `main.dart`.
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **State Management:** BLoC
- **Networking:** Dio
- **Dependency Injection:** GetIt
- **Navigation:** GoRouter
- **Localization:** EasyLocalization
- **Crash Reporting:** Firebase Crashlytics
- **Image Loading & Caching:** CachedNetworkImage

## API
Fotosfera fetches images from the following endpoint:
```
GET https://ru.api.dev.photograf.io/v1/jobEvaluation/images?continuationToken={token}
```
- `continuationToken` is used for pagination.
- Images are fetched and displayed in a grid format with three columns.
- The optimal image variant is selected based on the available space.
- New pages are loaded when scrolling reaches the bottom, utilizing `continuationToken`.

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Commit and Pre-Push Hooks

To maintain high code quality, Fotosfera utilizes automated scripts:

- **Pre-commit Hook:**
  - Automatically runs static analysis, formatting, and tests before allowing commits.

- **Pre-push Hook:**
  - Verifies tests are passing before pushing changes.

These scripts prevent committing or pushing code that does not meet the quality standards.

### How to Enable Git Hooks
1. Make the scripts executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x pre_merge_check.sh
   ```

2. Set up the Git hooks:
   ```sh
   cp pre_merge_check.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
   cp pre_merge_check.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
   ```

### Running Tests
Run unit tests using:
```sh
flutter test
```
